Theorem: If it is possible to buy x, x+1,â€¦, x+5 sets of McNuggets, for some x, then it is
possible to buy any number of McNuggets >= x, given that McNuggets come in 6, 9 and 20
packs.

Any number after x could be written as:
n = x + 6a + b (where a = [0, inf) and b = [0, 5] for each a)
Given that x + b are diophantine (since x to x + 5 are diophantine), and 6a is also diophantine (can be wholly divisible
by 6), n is also diophantine
